        <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to develop a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.</p>
        <p>I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to <em>sell</em> yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>
        <p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.</p>
        <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrate what I mean.</p>
        <p>"How big would you dream, if you <strong>knew</strong> you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about.</p>
        <p>I'm happy to chat over coffe some time about how I can help your company.</p>
